// serverInstructions is returned to the client in the initialize handshake
// (mcp server.WithInstructions). Clients surface it to the model at the start
// of every session, which is what makes the memory tools get called even in
// hosts that never read CLAUDE.md or AGENTS.md — the failure mode behind
// issues #3 and #14.
//
// It is built from compile-time constants on purpose. The initialize response
// is not a data channel: this text must never contain store contents, agent
// IDs, or anything derived from runtime state (see docs/threat-model.md on
// treating memory as untrusted input — recalled facts reach the model through
// tool results inside the session, never through this field). The one
// interpolation is memory.FeedbackAction, itself a source constant: the
// briefing names the same action the block prints and the CLI registers, so
// the three surfaces cannot drift apart.
//
// Budget: the text rides every initialize of every client, so its recurring
// token cost has to stay trivial against the savings it produces. The
// TestServerInstructionsBudget test pins it at 240 tokens via the same
// estimator every benchmark uses; raise the budget in that test, with
// reasoning, rather than growing the copy silently.
//
// Step 6 exists because two measured arms proved the weak-match block alone
// is not a teaching channel: with the block firing and the command
// resolving, two model-instances ran 217 recalls and wrote zero aliases —
// 98 and 119 calls against the instructed baseline of 6. The protocol had
// to move to where the agent is already looking: the session briefing.

1. Resume work with checkpoint_resume first.
2. Before your first substantive reply, inspect the newest hook block from the session's initial turn; ignore examples and older turns. Marker agent_id differs? run both project and __shared__ searches: shared duplicates may appear under ## Memory. Matching identity? Reuse non-empty sections; search every missing scope.
3. Hooks and MCP are complementary: memory_search/memory_search_batch serve focused, ad-hoc lookups.
4. memory_add stores durable preferences, decisions and milestones; memory_reflect action=update replaces stale versions.
5. checkpoint_save before context overload or stopping mid-task.
6. A weak-match note means vocabulary gaps: reformulate once with its terms; declare differing vocabulary with %s before more synonyms.
Confidence is writer-declared: verified/inferred/unverified, never automated verification. Add omission is inferred; update omission caps weakest target at inferred. Search/batch: min_confidence, confidence_weight [0,0.5], default 0; zero keeps filters. Filters suppress graph hints; explain shows final scores. Unsupported options require daemon upgrade/restart.
