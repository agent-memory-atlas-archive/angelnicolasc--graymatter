// BatchRecall answers many queries in one call, fanning them out across
// goroutines.
//
// The reason this exists is a measured one, and it is about turns rather than
// milliseconds. An agent holding several open questions had to issue one recall
// per question, and each recall is a round trip through the model: the wall
// clock is spent in the conversation, not in the store. Measured against a
// flat memory file the agent could grep in a single call, the recall-per-query
// shape lost on turns while winning on tokens — the engine was never the
// bottleneck, the interface was.
//
// Ranking is untouched. Each query is scored exactly as Recall would score it
// alone, so a batch of one is indistinguishable from a plain Recall. What the
// batch adds is the fan-out and a merged view (see MergedFacts) for callers
// that want one deduplicated block instead of k separate lists.

	// an agent asking six questions should get the five answers that worked,
	// not a single error for all of them.
	Err error `json:"-"`
}

// BatchRecall runs each query concurrently and returns one result per query,
// in the order the queries were given. The order is deterministic and matches
// the input regardless of which goroutine finishes first, because a caller
// pairing answers to questions positionally must not depend on scheduling.
//
// Concurrency is bounded by GOMAXPROCS: the store's own read path is already
// parallel-safe, but an unbounded fan-out on a 200-query batch would create
// 200 simultaneous bbolt read transactions and vector searches for no gain.
