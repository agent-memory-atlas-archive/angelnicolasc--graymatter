# API Stability

## Compatibility promise (v0.x series)

Starting with **v0.1.0**, GrayMatter follows a best-effort compatibility policy for the identifiers listed below:

- **No removals or signature changes** within the v0.x series without a deprecation notice in the prior minor release.
- **Struct fields** listed as stable will not be removed; new fields may be added.
- **Store internals** (unexported fields, internal packages) are not covered — do not embed `Store` or depend on unexported symbols.
- When v1.0.0 is released, full semver guarantees apply.

### `github.com/angelnicolasc/graymatter/pkg/memory`

| Identifier | Notes |
|---|---|
| `Open(cfg StoreConfig) (*Store, error)` | |
| `(*Store).Put(ctx, agentID, text string) error` | |
| `(*Store).PutReturningFact(ctx, agentID, text string) (Fact, error)` | Added after v0.18.0. Concrete `Store` capability, intentionally not part of `AdvancedStore`; returns the exact fact committed so callers can persist its identity without a post-write lookup |
| `(*Store).PutWithOptionsReturningFact(ctx, agentID, text, WriteOptions) (Fact, error)` | Added in v0.20.0. Text, confidence, canonical ID and index maintenance commit in the same fact transaction |
| `(*Store).ReviseWithOptions`, `ReviseFactsWithOptions` | Added in v0.20.0. Conservative omitted confidence, exact replacement identity; return a known committed replacement alongside a later retirement error |
| `(*Store).RecallWithOptions`, `RecallExplainWithOptions`, `RecallSharedWithOptions`, `RecallAllWithOptions`, `BatchRecallWithOptions` | Added in v0.20.0. Per-call options; nonpositive `topK` uses 8. Existing raw Store recall signatures keep their legacy zero-count behavior |
| `(*Store).DefaultConfidenceWeight() float64` | Optional adapter capability added in v0.20.0; advertises the configured default so request routing and negotiated RPC retain the same effective policy |
| `WriteOptions`, `RecallOptions`, `RecallResult`, `RecallExplainResult`, `RetrievalMetadata`, `ConfidenceRanking` | Added in v0.20.0. Optional pointer fields distinguish omission from explicit labels/zero; additive result metadata is omitted for legacy calls |
| `EligibleVectorStore`, `ExhaustiveVectorStore` | Optional capabilities added in v0.20.0; `VectorStore` and `AdvancedStore` require no new methods |
| `(*Store).Delete(agentID, factID string) error` | |
| `(*Store).List(agentID string) ([]Fact, error)` | |
| `(*Store).ListAgents() ([]string, error)` | |
| `(*Store).Stats(agentID string) (MemoryStats, error)` | |
| `(*Store).UpdateFact(agentID string, f Fact) error` | |

| `(*Store).RecallShared(ctx, query string, topK int) ([]string, error)` | |
| `(*Store).RecallAll(ctx, agentID, query string, topK int) ([]string, error)` | |
| `(*Store).RecallExplain(ctx, agentID, query string, topK int) ([]RecallReceipt, error)` | Added in v0.17.0. The same ranking as `Recall` — identical order, dedup and access-metadata side effects — with one receipt per returned fact instead of bare text. KG neighbour enrichment is text-only and has no receipts, so it is not part of the explain result |
| `RecallReceipt` struct (`text`, `weight`, `age_days`, `ranks`, `provenance`, `kg_links`) | Added in v0.17.0. JSON tags are the wire contract for `graymatter recall --explain --json` and the MCP `explained` payload |
| `RecallRanks` struct (`vector_rank`, `keyword_rank`, `recency_rank`, `fused_score`, `k`) | Added in v0.17.0. A rank of 0 means the signal did not rank the fact; the fused score reproduces from the ranks and `k` using the documented RRF arithmetic |
| `RecallProvenance` struct (`fact_id`, `written_at`, `superseded_by`, `confidence`, `pinned`) | Added in v0.17.0 |
| `(*Store).PutShared(ctx, text string) error` | |
| `(*Store).MaybeConsolidate(ctx, agentID string, cfg ConsolidateConfig) error` | |
| `(*Store).Consolidate(ctx, agentID string, cfg ConsolidateConfig) error` | |
| `(*Store).Close() error` | |
| `(*Store).SetKG(graph GraphAccessor, extractor EntityExtractorAccessor)` | |
| `(*Store).DB() *bolt.DB` | |
| `Fact` struct — all fields present in v0.1.0 | New fields may be added; `SupersededBy` added in v0.10.0; `Confidence` added in v0.12.0; `Pinned`/`PinnedAt` added in v0.14.0 (zero values reproduce pre-v0.14 behaviour; older stores load as unpinned) |
| `(Fact).IsSuperseded() bool` | Added in v0.10.0 |
| `SupersededByAgent` constant | Added in v0.10.0 |
| `MemoryStats` struct | |
| `StoreConfig` struct — all fields present in v0.1.0 | New fields may be added; `SignalWeights` and `MinRelevance` added in v0.10.0 |
| `SignalWeights` struct | Added in v0.10.0 |
| `DefaultSignalWeights() SignalWeights` | Added in v0.10.0 |
| `ErrConsolidateLLMUnsupported` | Added in v0.10.0. Deprecated in v0.14.0: never returned anymore (Ollama consolidation is implemented); kept so `errors.Is` callers keep compiling |
| `SharedAgentID` constant | |
| `ConsolidateConfig` interface | **v0.14.0:** gained `GetOllamaURL()` and `GetOllamaConsolidateModel()`. This is a signature-level change to a stable identifier, taken with the deviation documented in the 0.14.0 changelog compatibility notes instead of a prior-minor deprecation cycle. Callers using `graymatter.Config` are unaffected; hand-rolled implementers add two getters |
| `GraphAccessor` interface | |
| `EntityExtractorAccessor` interface | |
| `TypedEntityExtractor` interface, `EntityRef`, `EntityLink` | Added in v0.12.0 — optional extractor capability preserving label + type and producing co-mention links; consolidation uses it when implemented, legacy ID-only path otherwise |
| `EdgeWriter` interface | Added in v0.12.0 — optional graph capability used by consolidation to persist co-mention edges |
| `AdvancedStore.SetKG(...)` | Exposed in v0.12.0 (mirrors `(*Store).SetKG`) |
| `(*Store).ConsolidationCounters()`, `ReadConsolidationCounters(db)` | Added in v0.14.0 — lifetime consolidation totals from the meta bucket, surfaced by `status` and `doctor` |

### Recall result ordering

**Recall result ordering is deterministic: descending final score, oldest
first, then ID.**

With zero confidence weight the final score is the existing fused RRF score.
An explicit confidence filter first restricts the corpus. Without a filter and
with zero weight, scores and selection retain the previous arithmetic.

The same query against the same store returns the same facts in the same order,
on every call, on every platform. Facts that score equally are ordered by
`CreatedAt` ascending, and facts created in the same instant by fact ID
ascending, which makes the order total.

This is a guarantee callers may rely on within each namespace. It applies to
`Recall` and `RecallShared`, and every configuration of `SignalWeights` and
`MinRelevance`. `RecallAll` combines those input rankings by namespace RRF and
breaks ties by agent-list position, shared-list position, then text. Batch merge
orders by best input rank, number of query hits, then first appearance.

**Exception, v0.12.0:** when a knowledge graph is wired via `SetKG` (directly,
via `AdvancedStore.SetKG`, or by enabling the daemon's `--kg` /
`GRAYMATTER_KG=1`), `Recall` may append **at most three** neighbour labels
after the ranked facts. The first `topK` entries keep the deterministic order
above; appended entries are enrichment hints, capped and deduplicated, and
never displace a ranked fact. Without a wired graph the exception does not
exist and `Recall` returns at most `topK` distinct eligible facts.

An explicit `min_confidence`, including `unverified`, suppresses this text-only
enrichment because graph labels have no confidence receipts. Retrieval metadata
reports `kg: "suppressed_min_confidence"`; without a filter it describes hints
as `"hints_without_confidence_receipts"`. Explain never adds that hint tail.

### Confidence options

These APIs and MCP/CLI options are available since v0.20.0 and absent from
v0.19.1. Labels are writer declarations, not probabilities or verification by
GrayMatter. New writes accept exactly `verified`, `inferred` or `unverified`.
Absent/empty historical labels are effectively inferred; unknown historical
labels are preserved and treated as unverified. Explicit invalid/null options
are rejected before effects.

An omitted add label retains the legacy empty representation. An omitted revise
label becomes `min(inferred, lowest effective confidence of the validated live
targets)`; an explicit label overrides it. Summaries use the same conservative
minimum over valid consumed IDs, and LLM-extracted facts are unverified. The
replacement fact's write is atomic; subsequent retirements remain separate
phases and their failures are reported. A revision never inherits a pin.
Narrow lifecycle mutations preserve unrelated confidence metadata.

`RecallOptions.MinConfidence` filters before document frequencies, signal ranks,
recency, fusion, `MinRelevance`, deduplication and top-k. An optional finite
`ConfidenceWeight` in `[0, 0.5]` multiplies base RRF score `B` by
`1 + weight * c`, where verified has `c = +1`, inferred/legacy `c = 0` and
unverified/unknown `c = -1`. `ConfidencePolicy` is `confidence-v1`.
`ranks.fused_score` remains `B`; the additive receipt `ranking` object identifies
the final score that controls selection. Explicit zero weight preserves filters.
Query options do not mutate global configuration.
`Config.ConfidenceWeight` and `StoreConfig.ConfidenceWeight` set the configured
request default within the same finite range. Omitted per-call weights use that
default; explicit zero overrides it. An omitted RPC weight uses the configured
default advertised by the actual server connection, unless the client supplies
`DialOptions.DefaultConfidenceWeight`. A server that does not advertise a default
uses the client's product default. Adapters send the resolved value explicitly;
batch resolves it once after connection preflight and before fan-out, keeping
one policy if the daemon restarts during the batch. Reconnection renegotiates
the default for later requests.

Both product and low-level defaults remain zero in v0.20.0.
A future positive product default requires explicit notice in a published
minor release and promotion in a subsequent minor release after the frozen
quality gates pass. v0.20.0 does not announce a positive default or close
issue #126. Explicit zero remains the legacy ranking opt-out and preserves
any requested filter.

New RPC methods negotiate `confidence-write-v1`, `confidence-recall-v1`,
`confidence-lifecycle-v1` and `confidence-shared-write-v1`. The separate shared
write capability provides `PutSharedWithOptionsReturningFact` and preserves
`RememberShared`'s policy of scheduling no automatic consolidation. A generic
write with `agent_id = "__shared__"` retains the ordinary `Remember` consolidation
policy. Existing RPC methods retain zero confidence preference.
A new client can use an old daemon for an effectively legacy request, but new
options or an active positive default require a supporting capability; otherwise
the request returns an update/restart error before effects. Reconnection
renegotiates capabilities. Writes with uncertain commit results are not replayed.
Pin, unpin and forget remain available against an older daemon: after negotiating
the absence of `confidence-lifecycle-v1`, the client reads each target's current
metadata and uses the historical `UpdateFact` endpoint once. This compatibility
path retains the old daemon's read-modify-write concurrency limitations; upgraded
daemons use transactional field patches. An error after sending a mutation never
switches endpoints or replays that mutation. Revision requires
`confidence-write-v1` even when the label is omitted, because conservative
confidence derivation and transactional source validation are new semantics.
The REST API retains its legacy endpoints and zero preference; authenticated
MCP over HTTP includes the new options.

Filtered vector retrieval requires the native eligible-ID capability or an
optional custom capability that proves exhaustion. `VectorStore.Query` promises
only at-most-n results; a short list cannot prove completeness. Progressive
queries reuse one embedding and reject incomplete/no-progress prefixes.
Keyword-only search remains supported without a vector capability.
Concurrent confidence updates cannot mix eligibility with different receipt
metadata. Once a query embedding exists, an overlapping alias edit that changes
the effective query returns an explicit retry error before another embedding.

Before v0.11.0 the ordering of equal-scoring facts was unspecified in practice:
the three signal rankings were sorted with a comparator that read only the
score, and `sort.Slice` is not stable, so tied facts received arbitrary ranks
which the fusion then read. Nothing about the scores has changed — only the
resolution of ties.

### Additions in v0.10.0

Three additions, all fields or new identifiers, no signature changes — so the
compatibility promise above holds and no caller needs to do anything.

Each new field's zero value reproduces the previous behaviour exactly, which is
enforced rather than asserted:

| Field | Zero value | Behaviour at zero |
|---|---|---|
| `Fact.SupersededBy` | `""` | Fact is live. Stores written before v0.10.0 have no `superseded_by` key and load as live — checked against a literal v0.9.0 JSON fact |
| `StoreConfig.SignalWeights` | `nil` | `DefaultSignalWeights()` — vector 1.0, keyword 1.0, recency 0.5, the values that were hardcoded before v0.10.0. It is a pointer precisely so the zero value cannot be confused with "all signals off" |
| `StoreConfig.MinRelevance` | `0` | No relevance floor; `Recall` returns exactly `topK`, the pre-v0.10.0 contract |

`TestRankingDefaults_MatchV09Behaviour` is the gate: with the ranking fields
unset, results must be identical to the v0.9.0 ranking.

One default did change, and it is a behaviour change rather than an addition:
**the REST server's default `k` moved from 5 to 8**, matching
`DefaultConfig().TopK` and every other entry point. `GET /recall` with no `k`
now returns 8 facts. Pass `?k=5` for the old count.

## MCP wire contract (stable within the v0.x series)

The Go package that implements the MCP server, `cmd/graymatter/internal/mcp`,
is internal and carries no Go-level guarantee (see [Internal / unstable
packages](#internal--unstable-packages)). The **wire contract it serves** is
different: any MCP client — in any language, often with no Go dependency at
all — compiles against the payloads below. Within the v0.x series:

- **Tool names, parameter names, and required parameters** will not be removed or renamed.
- **`outputSchema` objects are authoritative**: a success result's
  `structuredContent` conforms to the tool's declared schema. Each result
  shape sets `additionalProperties: false` — on a `oneOf` union, each branch,
  since a root-level constraint would apply to every branch. New keys arrive
  only through a schema revision, never silently.
- **Text content** remains functionally equivalent to `structuredContent` per
  the MCP compatibility guidance. Exact prose wording is best-effort and may
  be reworded; clients should read the structured payload.
- Changes that would break a conforming client follow the same deprecation
  rule as the Go identifiers above: notice in the prior minor release.
- Tool calls on one connection **may execute concurrently** (the stdio server
  runs a worker pool): a response guarantees only its own effects, and
  clients must not rely on cross-request ordering within a stream. A client
  that needs write-then-read visibility must wait for the write's response
  first.
- Enforcement is mechanical, not aspirational: `tdqs_contract_test.go` (tool
  set, titles, descriptions, input schemas), `structured_contract_test.go`
  (payload ↔ `outputSchema` agreement), and `annotations_test.go` (safety
  hints) fail CI on drift.

The tables below reflect the definitions served by `graymatter mcp serve`,
verified against a live `tools/list` exchange at the time of writing.

### Tools

| Tool | Required parameters | Optional parameters |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_search` | `agent_id`, `query` | `top_k` (default `8`), `explain` (boolean, default `false`), `min_confidence`, `confidence_weight` (since v0.20.0) |
| `memory_search_batch` | `agent_id`, `queries` | `top_k` (default `8`), `min_confidence`, `confidence_weight` (since v0.20.0) |
| `memory_add` | `agent_id`, `text` | `confidence` (since v0.20.0) |
| `memory_alias` | `agent_id`, `term`, `equivalents` | — |
| `checkpoint_save` | `agent_id` | `state` (string containing a JSON object) |
| `checkpoint_resume` | `agent_id` | `on_missing` (`"error"` \| `"empty"`, default `"error"`) |
| `memory_reflect` | `action`, plus at least one explicit valid `agent_id` (canonical) or `agent` (deprecated alias; `agent_id` wins when both are valid) | `text`, `target` |

`memory_reflect.action` is an enum: `add`, `update`, `forget`, `link`, `pin`,
`unpin`. Its input schema is a flat object with `required: ["action"]`, no
root `anyOf`, `oneOf`, or `allOf`, and `additionalProperties: false`. Both
identity spellings remain schema-optional so canonical-only and alias-only
callers can pass client validation. At least one explicit identity is required
at runtime for both stdio and HTTP; no identity is derived from the working
directory. An identity-free object passes the schema but returns a tool error
before any backend call.

Every supplied `agent_id` or `agent` must be a non-empty string that is not
entirely whitespace. Null, wrong types, empty strings, and whitespace-only
strings are rejected even when the other field is valid. When both fields are
valid, `agent_id` wins. Valid identities are not trimmed or normalized:
`" project "` and `"project"` address distinct namespaces; Unicode and
`__shared__` are accepted. This hardens malformed inputs that previously could
fall back to the alias or ignore an invalid alias without changing valid
callers. See [ADR-014](decisions/014-agent-id-canonical.md).

Since v0.20.0, `confidence` is accepted on reflect `add`/`update` only. Search
options on writes, confidence on other tools/actions, explicit null, wrong
types, unknown labels and non-finite/out-of-range weights are errors. The runtime
validates these new options explicitly; it does not enable global strict MCP
argument validation as a side effect.

### `structuredContent` payloads

| Tool | Success payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_search` | `{"agent_id", "query", "count", "facts", "feedback"?}` | `facts` is nullable in the schema; the empty result is `count: 0, facts: []` with a "No memories found" text notice. `feedback` is optional: it carries the weak-match vocabulary block when the query's vocabulary barely overlaps the store's (v0.18.0), omitted otherwise |
| `memory_search` with `explain: true` | `{"agent_id", "query", "count", "facts", "explained"?}` | Added in v0.17.0. `explained` carries one `RecallReceipt` per fact (same JSON shape as the Go type); `facts` is present but empty so the payload conforms to the declared schema. The ranking is identical to `explain: false` — explain only reads it out |
| `memory_search_batch` | `{"agent_id", "count", "merged", "per_query"}` | `count` is the number of distinct facts in `merged`; `per_query[]` carries `{"query", "facts", "error"?}` — a per-query failure is reflected in `per_query[].error` while the other query results still return successfully |
| `memory_add` | `{"agent_id", "stored"}` | `stored` is `true` on success |
| `memory_alias` | `{"agent_id", "term", "equivalents", "stored"}` | `stored` is `true` on success |
| `checkpoint_save` | `{"agent_id", "checkpoint_id", "created_at"}` | `created_at` is RFC3339 |
| `checkpoint_resume` | `{"id", "created_at", "state"?, "message_count"?}` | `state` is the persisted JSON object; keys marked `?` may be absent when empty |
| `checkpoint_resume` with `on_missing: "empty"` | `{"found": false, "agent_id"}` | Added in v0.20.0. The successful absence result; `found` is always `false` and is declared non-optional. The output schema declares this shape and the success shape under `oneOf` |
| `memory_reflect` | `{"action", "agent", "ok"}` | `ok` is `true` on success |

Confidence calls added in v0.20.0 preserve these keys and add declared optional
schema fields. Explicit-label add/update results carry `fact_id` and
`confidence`. Search, explain and batch add optional `retrieval` with effective
`min_confidence`, `confidence_weight`, `policy` and `kg`, including empty results.
Explain receipts add optional `ranking` with `base_score`, `final_score`,
`factor`, `effective_confidence`, `confidence_weight` and `policy`. Text reports
the same policy and identifies final scores. Legacy calls omit the new metadata.
Batch applies one global policy to all input queries and its merged view.

### Checkpoint resume absence and default

Errors return text-only `isError: true` results without `structuredContent`;
their wording may change. `checkpoint_resume` with no checkpoint returns such
an error **by default**; the optional `on_missing` parameter (`"error"` — the
default — or `"empty"`) lets a caller opt into the successful
`{"found": false, "agent_id"}` result above instead. This is an additive
option in v0.20.0, not a behaviour change for existing callers. **Advance
notice:** a default change to `"empty"` in **v0.21.0** is conditional on a
successful real OpenChamber/OpenCode smoke and publication of this prior-minor
notice and the matching changelog notice, per the deprecation rule above.
If the client rejects the union schema, apply and validate the documented
fallback before publishing
v0.20.0, keep `"error"` as the default, and defer the default change.
Callers that depend on absence being an error should pass `on_missing: "error"`
explicitly; it remains accepted as the legacy behaviour throughout v0.x.
Storage, daemon, and corrupt-record failures stay prose-only in both modes. The
former `{"error": "not_found", "agent_id"}` payload violated the declared
success schema and was removed to prevent strict clients from rejecting the
entire response (#117; [ADR-013 amendment](decisions/013-structured-tool-results.md));
the machine-readable absence result that amendment deferred is
[ADR-015](decisions/015-checkpoint-resume-empty-result.md).
